# Trimster
Another small program. This one, just to cut videos in 30 second segments for WhatsApp statuses.
# Usage
To use it, you just need to execute it in the same folder as the video you want to trim. Once you open it, you just type the name of the file that you want to trim. Example: "Test Video.mp4" (without the parenthesis). Then you wait, and all the videos will appear in the same folder.
## Libraries Used
